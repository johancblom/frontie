# Frontie - Front-end HTML5 Boilerplate

Frontie is a front-end HTML5 boilerplate using Gulp for task automation.

## Notes

### Why don't you include everything from Bootstrap 4?

It's a really great front-end framework for many projects but in some cases it might be just too large and complex. I only took what I needed from it which is grid system and responsive breakpoints. If you need more stuff then you can easily import it.
