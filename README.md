# Frontend Development Starter Kit (NodeJS/NPM/Gulp/Browsersync/Sass/HTML5 Boilerplate/Bootstrap 4 Grid system)

Frontend Development Starter Kit is a lightweight front-end development starter kit using Gulp for task automation. Based on HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap 4 Grid system enhanced with SASS and Browsersync.

## Why another frontend development starter kit? Just to keep things simple.

I like to keep things as simple as possible so when I work on smaller static pojects, I very often start from scratch just to have the better control over the code.

It's the same routine and tools:
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for task automation
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Bootstrap 4 Grid](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)
* [Bootstrap 4 Responsive Breakpoints](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS preprocessor
* [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-autoprefixer)
* [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/)

I also use [Twig.js](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js) as a template engine so I might include this one here as well.

### Why don't you include everything from Bootstrap 4?

It's a really great frontend framework for many projects but in some cases it might be just too large and complex. I only took what I needed from it which is grid system and responsive breakpoints. If you need more stuff then please feel free to add more things from this amazing framework.

### Other tools

There are many more nice tools out there like ES6/Bower/Babel/Babelify/Browserify which I don't need at the moment for projects based on this specific starter kit.
