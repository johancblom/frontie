# Frontend Development Starter Kit | Gulp | HTML5 Boilerplate | Bootstrap 4 Grid system | Sass | Autoprefixer | Browsersync

Frontend Development Starter Kit is a lightweight starter kit using Gulp for task automation. Based on HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap 4 Grid system enhanced with SASS, Autoprefixer plus Browsersync. These things make it a solid frontend boilerplate to get a new project off the ground.

## Core features
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for task automation
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Bootstrap 4 Grid System](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)
* [Bootstrap 4 Responsive Breakpoints](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS preprocessor
* [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-autoprefixer)
* [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/)

I also use [Twig.js](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js) as a template engine which hasn't been included yet but I might to include this one here as well.

## Quick start
**Download all the project dependencies:**
```sh
npm install
```

**Watch and develop:**
```sh
gulp
```

**Generate a fresh build of your project to /dist folder:**
```sh
gulp build
```

## Installation requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

## Notes

### Why another frontend development starter kit?

To keep the frontend boilerplate as simple as possible. Use web tools that you really need.


### Why don't you include everything from Bootstrap 4?

It's a really great frontend framework for many projects but in some cases it might be just too large and complex. I only took what I needed from it which is grid system and responsive breakpoints. If you need more stuff then you can easily import it to this starter kit.

### Other tools

There are many more nice tools out there like ES6/Bower/Babel/Babelify/Browserify. You might wonder why these are not included here? The thing is I don't really need these too much at the moment - of course for smaller projects based on this specific starter kit.
